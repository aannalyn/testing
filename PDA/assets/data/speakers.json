While it is true that a DSLR renders the best images for documenting cases, the cost, weight of the camera, and learning curve makes the whole process of documenting cases tremendously intimidating. The development of recent technologies in the mobile phone industry, the mobile cellphone camera establishes itself as an acceptable alternative to the DSLR in the daily dental practice. The ease of use and accessibility of the mobile device allows any dental practitioner to practice case documentation. The goal of the lecture is to review how to use the mobile cellphone device cameras, teach new techniques using innovative mobile cellphone camera technologies, making dental documentation easy, fast and artistic.</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>The Philippine Society for Developmental & Behavioral Pediatricians (PSDBP), under the umbrella of the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS), cannot advocate for the well-being of more than 40 million Filipino youth just by itself. With only 61 board-certified practicing developmental pediatricians and the rising rate of depression and suicide in the Philippines, there is much needed support from all sectors involved in child care. As such, the PPS Task Force on Mental Health for Children & Youth, in collaboration with the Philippine Society for Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (PSCAP), together with the Philippine Society for Adolescent Medicine Specialists (PSAMS) and PSDBP developed a training module for general practitioners on the recognition and initial management of common mental health issues. This workshop has now reached 744 pediatricians, 940 educators, 350 parents, and 100 college students who were taught to identify signs of depression and suicidal behavior within their community. Moreover, participants are educated on how to properly guide affected family and friends to qualified mental health practitioners. On a national level, the PPS has been a strong voice for the signed Philippine Mental Health Law (Republic Act 11036) that will provide mental health services down to the barangay level and integrate mental health programs in hospitals. We are seeking the assistance of relevant private and public institutions to further implement this law. Our final goal is to nurture a strategic, integrated and efficient mental healthcare system amidst the limited resources of the country.#PowerInYou</p>",

Fracture or loss of the restorat ion i s also a common problem.Traditionally, for small tooth defects it is appropriate to use composite resins. However, if a large amount of tooth structure is missing, porcelain veneers are preferred. Today, lithium disilicate glass ceramic is the most widely used material to fabricate highly esthetic indirect restorations. However, this requires a high level of skill and technical knowledge for both the dentist and the technician to achieve an optimum esthetic result to meet patient’s high expectation. This presentation will discuss important clinical parameters for porcelain veneers to achieve efficacy such as tooth preparation, shade analysis/ shade matching and the essential guidelines in cementation.</p>",

Periodontal treatments spare no effort in saving teeth but couldn’t reach its full extend. In contemporary dentistry, dental implants have been considered an optimal choice when teeth are missing.

In the dilemma of saving teeth and placing implants, we expect either one to be maintained in function and long-term health. This presentation is to share my clinical experiences and long-term observations in treating periodontally compromised dentitions.

The prevalent misuse of antibiotics in the health industry has led to an increase in antibiotic resistance, and it is estimated that by 2030 millions of people will be resistant to antibiotics. The dental health profession has been identified as one of the health fields known to prescribe antibiotics incorrectly and unnecessarily. In this lecture, the diagnosis and management of pulpal and periapical diseases is elaborated, and further discusses how antibiotics are not recommended for irreversible pulpitis, acute apical periodontitis, draining sinus tracts, flare-up prevention, or post-incision and drainage of a localized abscess in an otherwise healthy patient. In these situations, the use of antibiotics carries no benefit to the patient but may put him or her at risk to antibiotic side effects or microbial resistance in the long run. Moreover, the lecture will explain which cases may require antibiotics to prevent further infection and assist in recovery, such as prophylactic coverage for systemic conditions that medically mandates antibiotic use and treatment of progressive or persistent endodontic</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>The proportion of older people continues to grow worldwide, especially in developing countries. Poor oral health frequently leads to dysfunction, discomfort, and disability. Missing teeth, retained root fragments, rootsurface decay, periodontal pockets and xerostomia are associated with high levels of social impact. Despite reported increasing trends in tooth retention, dependence on prosthodontic treatment is still high. Approximately 60% of denture users have at least one problem with a denture and the condition of the full dentures worn was are invariably unsatisfactory. There is a wide discrepancy between the normative and perceived needs of this elderly population. These patients, once having received the denture would find it difficult to further visit a dentist for routine follow-up on their own initiative. The challenges to provision of primary healthcare for this population lie in the shortage of dental manpower and reorientation of oral health services towards prevention. Research for better oral health should focus beyond the biomedical and clinical aspects of their oral health. The WHO recommends that countries adopt innovative strategies for improving the oral health of their disadvantaged and vulnerable elderly population. WHO also supports national capacity building in the oral health of older people through intercountry and interregional exchange of experiences</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>Imaging has been a part of the health care sector for a long time now even though its beginnings started with just only anatomy or pathology manually drawn by hand either for teaching or record keeping purposes. However, diagnostic imaging had to wait for the discovery of x-ray, which later led to a remarkable change in how patients would be examined and in how anatomy and pathology would be viewed. In order to properly guard the oral cavity, dental practitioners should be aware of the presence, benefits, and proper utilization of oral and maxillofacial radiology. It is not expected that a general practitioner (GP) should know everything about oral and maxillofacial radiology but it is necessary that a GP should have the basic skills to notice any radiographic deviations or changes on dental radiographs and rational enough to refer them to specialists for proper and thorough diagnosis or treatment if the GP cannot or opt not to do so. The main objective of this presentation is to highlight the importance of oral and maxillofacial radiology. It also aims to refresh our understanding and give updates on commonly used types of dental radiographic images. It will also show how to examine dental radiographs, identify normal anatomy, and detect common radiographic errors, complications, and pathologies. There will also be some cases to be presented for illustration purposes.</p>",

The ICCMSTM system, which was developed based on the early work of the International Caries Detection and Assessment System Foundation, uses the ICDAS index in caries detection and assessment. In contrast to the Black’s System that indicates the location of caries and focuses only on cavitated lesions, ICDAS records both the staging and activity of caries, and includes initial non-cavitated lesions on enamel. Recommended management modalities are provided based on individual caries risk and existing caries. ICDAS allows students to provide comprehensive caries management in the treatment planning that include the control of initial non-cavitated lesions and conservative restorative options for cavitated lesions. This would improve patient’s health outcomes through preserving tooth structure and maintaining the overall oral health.</p>",

Dealing with children with special needs require a lot of patience and compassion.

        "presentationContent": "<p>It is estimated that 10-20% of children have one or more mental or behavioral problems (WHO 2001). Why is the early detection and intervention of developmental problems so critical? Early detection leads to early intervention which, in turn, will lead to better outcomes. Having a disability is not the same as being handicapped. The goal for each child with special needs is to integrate him or her into mainstream society. This will be difficult to achieve if society is not ready to accept them. Our clinics can be more child-friendly and accessible to children with disabilities. Thus, I will discuss tips for improving our language related to people with disabilities. I will also cover the red flag signs in the various developmental domains (language, psychosocial, cognitive, gross motor, fine motor). Red flag signs in a child’s development suggest that a child could be at risk if not meeting his or her expected developmental milestones. When this occurs, it is not acceptable to do a “wait and see” approach and further investigation is strongly recommended. As these developmental domains are tackled, certain disorders will be addressed including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, learning disability, and cerebral palsy. Hopefully, I will be able to pique the interest of dentists in equipping themselves with the necessary knowledge and skills to support children with special needs and their families. Ultimately, this will allow greater optimization of their God-given potential and functionality in these children with special needs.Our supreme example of child development is seen in Jesus himself. In Luke 2: 52 it says, “And Jesus grew in wisdom (intellectual) and stature (physical), and in favor with God (spiritual) and men (socio-emotional).”</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>The recent findings in a study on the impact among dentists of the HMO dental services suggests several recommendations to improve the system of delivery of care to dental patients by both dentist and third-party players. It was recommended that a study on the rate setting of minimum services provided by the HMO be implemented to improve the system. Rate setting is defined as a process for determining a payment amount that a payer reimburses to a provider. Health financing and economics will be put into place to come up with minimum ideal costing for the required minimum services to be offered by HMO’s. In this paper, we have identified fixed and variable costs involved within an identified dental service to be covered by the HMO. The minimum services for the HMO dental insurance identified that are necessary are the following: Consultation,Scaling and Polishing, Restorative dentistry using permanent filling materials,Tooth extraction. This paper will also use the identified costs (fixed and variable costs) of procedures itemized it and justify the minimum total costs through break-even analysis. This will ensure quality and standardization in the delivery of services to HMO patients.</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>Ameloblastoma is commonly treated using radical resection. However, surgery may result to surgical morbidity and the need for reconstruction. Aside from this, the prohibitive cost for the surgery and reconstruction, becomes restrictive specially for patients in developing countries. The objective of this presentation it to show successful cases using modified marsuplialization and radical marsupialization for the management of unicystic, small multicystic and small solid lesions. A series of cases of ameloblastoma managed at the Oral Medicine Department of Delos Santos Medical Center between 1988 - 2012 will be presented. They have been managed either with modified marsupialization or radical marsupialization. Long term followup and results of the cases will likewise be discussed. Ameloblastoma presenting with a unicystic, small multi-cystic and small solid types can be managed conservatively with good percentage of success. The advantage of this alternative management approach maintains the patients’ facial contour, which negates the necessity for reconstruction and need to harvest bone from the donor site. Consequently, this lessens the cost of treatment, which is favorable to patients with financial challenges. However,a close follow up must be emphasized to the patient to be able to detect and manage recurrent lesions while they are still very small.</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>Most of you might have seen patients who complain of occlusal discomfort and may not be able to find any problems even after conducting various examinations. Since such patients complain of inexplicable symptoms, occlusal discomfort (occlusal dysesthesia) is often managed as a psychiatric problem. Dentists wish to rescue patients and occasionally perform irreversible treatment, such as occlusion adjustment and occlusal reconstruction, even if the occlusal state is not problematic. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the occlusal discomfort (occlusal dysesthesia). The Japanese Prosthodontic Society Clinical Practice Guideline Committee published a position paper on occlusal discomfort syndrome. Among them, the occlusal discomfort syndrome was classified into broad and narrow senses. The narrow sense (occlusal dysesthesia) is defined as a persistent (more than 6 months) uncomfortable bite sensation, which does not correspond to any physical alteration related to occlusion, pulp, periodontium, muscle or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and cause significant functional impairment. In addition, the following points were mentioned as features of patients under the narrow sense of occlusal discomfort syndrome. 2. Patients perceive occlusal contact as incorrect or with extreme sensitivity even though their occlusion is normal. 4. Patients believe that systemic symptoms are related to the occlusion. 5. Patients repeatedly visit many dental/medical offices and claim that they have been experiencing psychosocial and occupational disadvantages. 7. Patients fully believe that their ‘‘occlusion is abnormal’’ even though no objective occlusal abnormalities are apparent. 8. Patients bring devices (e.g., prosthodontic devices, provisional crowns) provided during previous treatments, long letters/notes, and their own drawings when they visit new dental offices. 9. Patients usually refuse to visit psychiatrists even though psychiatric disorders/diseases are recognized, and usually refuse medications. In addition, in the previous reports, the cause of occlusal dysesthesia is attributed to psychological factors or neural transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system.</p>",

These factors contribute to increase in antimicrobial resistance which is a now global public health problem. Other countries have antimicrobial stewardship strategies. In the Philippines, the medical profession developed guidelines on prescribing antibiotics; however, none exists for dentistry.

We have made giant steps in improving adhesion to tooth structure since acid etching was introduced by Michael Buonocore in the 1950’s and total-etching was introduced by Professor Takao Fusayama in the 1980’s. Hundreds of studies have been done on bond strength, microleakage, nanoleakage, bonding substrates, composite resin materials, different application techniques that can simplify and placement of adhesive restorations with predictable outcome, resin cements among others, have been published. These have vastly improved the success rate and prolonged the longevity of adhesive restorations. But why do we still get failures such as secondary caries, post-operative sensitivities, fractures? This presentation will try to answer this question and give insights on the most up-to-date information and research works being done to further improve the complex world of adhesive restorations, focusing on materials used in adhesive dentistry, the characteristics of the adhesive bond and newly-developed materials and application techniques.</p>",

Increasing interest has been developed on the “Life’Like” restorations also known as biometric restorations. These are either porcelain or resin based restoration that can be performed on the anterior and the posterior areas of the mouth. They may adopt both an indirect and a direct technique. The common characteristics is that they are low stressed and highly bonded restorations able to reproduce the functional and optical characteristic of the natural dentition.</p><p>Anterior and posterior stress-reduced direct composite (SRDC) restorations may be selected for the restoration of structurally compromised teeth if six basic steps are rigorously respected:</p><ol> <li>Analysis of the occlusion and opposing dentition</li> <li>Cavity preparation and caries removal endpoints</li> <li>Analysis of residual tooth structure</li> <li>Preparation of the dental substrate to achieve a reliable bond to enamel ad dentine</li> <li>Control of polymerization stresses by using appropriate layering and curing techniques</li> <li>Occlusal force equilibration</li> </ol> <p>A unique class II technique first published in the JADA in 2002 will be resented along with further development in the last 12 years (Deliperi & Bardwell, 2002, 2006, Deliperi & Alleman, 2009 Deliperi et all, 2011).</p> <p>With a solid scientific background in mind and a continuous training clinicians may push the envelope of SDRC restorations.

        "presentationContent": "<p>Studies have shown a relationship between maternal periodontal diseases (PDs) and premature delivery. PDs are commonly encountered oral diseases which cause progressive damage to the periodontal ligament and alveolar bones, leading to loss of teeth and oral disabilities. PDs also adversely affect general health by worsening of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Moreover, maternal PDs are thought to be related to increasing the frequency of preterm-birth with low birth weight (PBLBW) in new-borns. Prematurity and immaturity are the leading causes of prenatal and infant mortality and is a major public health problem around the world. Inflamed periodontal tissues generate significantly high levels of proinflammatory cytokines that may have systemic effects on the host mother and the fetus. In addition, the bacteria that cause PDs produce endotoxins which can harm the fetus. Furthermore, studies have shown that microorganisms causing PDs can get access to the bloodstream, invading uterine tissues, to induce PBLBW. Another likely mechanism that connects PDs with adverse pregnancy outcome is maternal vitamin D status. A role of inadequate vitamin D status in the genesis of PDs has been reported. Administration of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy could reduce the risk of maternal infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. As maternal PDs are significant risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome, preventive antenatal care for pregnant women in collaboration with the obstetric and dental professions are required.</p>",

        "presentationContent": "<p>The regeneration of the pulp-dentin complex has been reported in several animal studies using exogenous biological cues or stem/ progenitor cells. The animal and human studies using endogenous biological molecules released from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-conditioned dentin or evoked bleeding have shown the formation of tissues that are of periodontal origin. Endogenous biological molecules have a release profile with a high initial burst followed by rapid reduction, perhaps accounting for the lack of regeneration in clinical studies.</p> <p>We investigated biological function and mechanisms of Cpne7 in regulation of dental and non-dental mesenchymal cell differentiation into odontoblasts via epithelial mesenchymal interaction. Cpne7 induces the differentiation of dental mesenchymal cells, such as human dental pulp cell (hDPCs) or non-dental origin mesenchymal cells, into odontoblasts and dentin formation in vivo.</p> <p>This presentation introduce the potential roles of Cpne7 in vital pulp therapy ( direct pulp capping, indirect pulp capping, hypersensitivity tx. ) and regenerative endodontic procedure through animal study. If we fully understand about Cpne 7 function and reactive mechanism, clinicians can induce artificially tertiary dentin that produced by such as caries, abfraction, or dental treatment to protect pulp tissue naturally.</p>",
