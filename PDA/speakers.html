                                    have been presented to reduce orthodontic relapse. The retention
                                    phase is maintenance of the accomplished proper occlusion. There
                                    are several factors that can contribute to relapse despite high
                                    standards of treatment. One factor is musculature and function. It has
                                    been noted that the achieved proper occlusion must be within the
                                    limits of normal muscle balance. Or musculature must adapt to the
                                    new positions of teeth during the retention phase. This presentation
                                    will approach orthodontic retention phase and the dynamic dentition,
                                    through the effects of normal muscle forces.

                                    Restoring anterior teeth is always a challenge. Oftentimes, dentists
                                    encounter a different shade of the restoration and the adjacent
                                    natural tooth which greatly affects the appearance of the teeth.
                                    Fracture or loss of the restoration is also a common
                                    problem.Traditionally, for small tooth defects it is appropriate to use
                                    composite resins. However, if a large amount of tooth structure is
                                    missing, porcelain veneers are preferred. Today, lithium disilicate
                                    glass ceramic is the most widely used material to fabricate highly
                                    esthetic indirect restorations. However, this requires a high level of
                                    skill and technical knowledge for both the dentist and the technician
                                    to achieve an optimum esthetic result to meet patient’s high
                                    expectation. This presentation will discuss important clinical
                                    parameters for porcelain veneers to achieve efficacy such as tooth
                                    preparation, shade analysis/ shade matching and the essential
                                    guidelines in cementation.

                                    This lecture will provide clinicians with an overview of differing biomimetic protocols and
                                    techniques to predictably restore the anterior and posterior dentition using a minimally
                                    invasive approach. Increasing interest has been developed on the “Life’Like” restorations also
                                    known as biometric restorations. These are either porcelain or resin based restoration that can
                                    be performed on the anterior and the posterior areas of the mouth. They may adopt both an
                                    indirect and a direct technique. The common characteristics is that they are low stressed and
                                    highly bonded restorations able to reproduce the functional and optical characteristic of the
                                    natural dentition.

                                    further development in the last 12 years (Deliperi & Bardwell, 2002, 2006, Deliperi & Alleman,

                                    With a solid scientific background in mind and a continuous training clinicians may push the
                                    envelope of SDRC restorations. By combining SRDC protocols on both the anterior and
                                    posterior dentition, it is possible to rehabilitate the worn dentition using a biomimetic
                                    approach.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It is no secret that Prosthetic Dental Implants have taken the dentistry by
                                    storm. Over the past 10 years advances in technology have paved the way
                                    for what we refer to as improved restorations fulfilling both the esthetic and
                                    functional needs of the patients. Long span plates have stepped aside to
                                    give way to biocompatible titanium fixtures stable enough to support both
                                    single and multiple unit prostheses. One thing that hasn’t changed though
                                    is the importance of occlusion as one of the main considerations in the
                                    treatment planning for prosthetic implants. In this modern age of dentistry,
                                    planning for prosthetic implants requires a TEAM APPROACH not just with
                                    the periodontist but with the orthodontist as well. The orthodontists plays
                                    an vital role in setting the teeth to the correct positions that allow proper
                                    implant placement, while maintaining a stable and harmonious bite that will
                                    ensure the longevity of the restoration and its supporting structures.
                                    Today’s topic will put emphasis on treatment planning guidelines for
                                    orthodontic adjunctive procedures such as management of spaces ( closure
                                    and opening) , molar uprighting and intrusion as well as other tooth
                                    movements that will help establish a stable occlusion therefore allowing the
                                    dental practitioner to restore edentulous spaces with prosthetic implants.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Most of you might have seen patients who complain of occlusal discomfort and may not
                                    be able to find any problems even after conducting various examinations. Since such
                                    patients complain of inexplicable symptoms, occlusal discomfort (occlusal dysesthesia) is
                                    often managed as a psychiatric problem. Dentists wish to rescue patients and occasionally
                                    perform irreversible treatment, such as occlusion adjustment and occlusal reconstruction,
                                    even if the occlusal state is not problematic. Therefore, it is clinically important to
                                    understand the occlusal discomfort (occlusal dysesthesia). The Japanese Prosthodontic
                                    Society Clinical Practice Guideline Committee published a position paper on occlusal
                                    discomfort syndrome. Among them, the occlusal discomfort syndrome was classified into
                                    broad and narrow senses. The narrow sense (occlusal dysesthesia) is defined as a
                                    persistent (more than 6 months) uncomfortable bite sensation, which does not correspond
                                    to any physical alteration related to occlusion, pulp, periodontium, muscle or
                                    temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and cause significant functional impairment. In addition,
                                    the following points were mentioned as features of patients under the narrow sense of
                                    occlusal discomfort syndrome. 2. Patients perceive occlusal contact as incorrect or with
                                    extreme sensitivity even though their occlusion is normal. 4. Patients believe that systemic
                                    symptoms are related to the occlusion. 5. Patients repeatedly visit many dental/medical
                                    offices and claim that they have been experiencing psychosocial and occupational
                                    disadvantages. 7. Patients fully believe that their ‘‘occlusion is abnormal’’ even though no
                                    objective occlusal abnormalities are apparent. 8. Patients bring devices (e.g.,
                                    prosthodontic devices, provisional crowns) provided during previous treatments, long
                                    letters/notes, and their own drawings when they visit new dental offices. 9. Patients
                                    usually refuse to visit psychiatrists even though psychiatric disorders/diseases are
                                    recognized, and usually refuse medications. In addition, in the previous reports, the cause
                                    of occlusal dysesthesia is attributed to psychological factors or neural transmission from
                                    the periphery to the central nervous system.

                                    Presentation Title: REHABILITATION OF OCCLUSION: SCIENCE OR ART
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The primary objective of occlusal rehabilitation is to improve the
                                    stomatognathic function of patients who have dysfunction or disability
                                    in mastication, speech or swallowing because of either tooth loss or
                                    other reasons. The procedure of occlusal treatment involves
                                    improving the morphology and the stomatognathic function. Several
                                    practical methods and morphological criteria have been described in
                                    occlusal rehabilitation such as mandibular position, occlusal plane,
                                    occlusal guidance, occlusal contact, face-bow transfer, use of an
                                    adjustable articulator and so on. Literature review on these criteria
                                    was performed and the results will be presented. Other important
                                    issues such as occlusion and temporomandibular disorders as well as
                                    occlusion and bruxism will also be discussed in this lecture.

                                    History will show that both medicine and dentistry have parallel
                                    observations regarding the relationship of sleep, breathing, and upper
                                    airway and craniofacial anatomy. From the time Sleep Medicine was
                                    established in the 1970s, it took over 20 years for physicians and dentists
                                    to come together to addressing sleep disorders. This talk will focus on
                                    the development of Sleep Medicine and Dentistry; their relationship in
                                    clinical practice and management of cases of sleep-related breathing
                                    disorders for adults and children.
